/**
 * Fastify adapter for awesome-node-auth.
 *
 * Bridges an `AuthRequestHandler` to Fastify's `preHandler` hook by
 * delegating to `req.raw` / `reply.raw` — the underlying Node.js
 * `IncomingMessage` / `ServerResponse` objects that Fastify exposes on
 * every request and reply.
 *
 * **No extra dependencies required.** This adapter works with any Fastify
 * version that exposes `.raw` on its request and reply objects (v3+).
 *
 * For mounting the full auth **router** (not just middleware) you still need
 * `@fastify/express`, because `auth.router()` returns an Express `Router`
 * that relies on Express-specific request decoration.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import Fastify from 'fastify';
 * import { fastifyAdapter } from 'awesome-node-auth/adapters/fastify';
 * import { createAuthMiddleware } from 'awesome-node-auth';
 *
 * const fastify = Fastify();
 * const authMiddleware = createAuthMiddleware(authConfig, userStore);
 *
 * // Protect all routes — verify the JWT on every request.
 * fastify.addHook('preHandler', fastifyAdapter(authMiddleware));
 *
 * fastify.get('/profile', async (request) => {
 *   return request.raw.user; // populated by awesome-node-auth middleware
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @since 1.7.0

 *
 * There is no runtime overhead beyond the extra function call; the original
 * handler is invoked directly.

 * fastify.addHook('preHandler', fastifyAdapter(authMiddleware));
